            <h1>When our minds get stuck in loops of fear, worry and worst case scenarios it has a way of taking over your life.</h1>
            <p>By the time you’ve found your way to this website, you’ve probably tried to control and change the way you’re feeling for a long time. Because most people who find their way to our clinic excel in many areas of their lives it’s often a very frustrating experience not to be able to control or stop the issue on their own.

                We are a small private Psychology Clinic made up of psychologists and psychiatrists seeing people both online and face-to-face in Central London. Whilst our original training and expertise are within the treatment of anxiety disorders and adjustment issues we are all about facilitating an environment where you can sharpen your mind, identify and ultimately let go of habitual patterns no longer serving you. We are a bi-lingual clinic and are proud to be able to cater to the Swedish community in London, as well as the English-speaking. On our team, we have both a Swedish-speaking psychologist and a Swedish-speaking psychiatrist.
                
                At the clinic we get to observe people every day, successfully finding a way out of patterns that have been holding them back</p>
